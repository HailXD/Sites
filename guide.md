Each folder is it's own page
Running build_and_push.bat will update the Projects.json in browser folder

Each folder should have a config.json
Sample:
```json
{
  "name": "SKChars",
  "description": "Soul Knight Character Viewer"
}
```

Where name is just a short name for the project and description is a short description
Projects can be hidden by keeping the description empty ""

Each project folder have it's own index.html, css, and js files
